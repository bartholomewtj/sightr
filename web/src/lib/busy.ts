// App-wide "the bar should show" signal. Two independent sources feed it:
//   1. Mutations — every WRITE to the bridge (reply, keys, prompt-option tap, upload, tab/space
//      create, pane close) increments a counter for its duration.
//   2. A SLOW load — a background revalidation (the poll) or a route navigation that stays in flight
//      past its own threshold sets a boolean (see hooks/use-poll-busy, which uses two independent
//      thresholds — snappy for navigation, longer for the ambient poll). A routine fast poll never
//      trips it, so the bar stays invisible on healthy traffic; only genuinely laggy loading does.
// The top <BusyBar/> reflects `count > 0 || pollStalled`. Background reads are otherwise NOT counted
// as mutations — they run on a constant timer, so the counter alone would never rest. Module-scoped,
// mirroring lib/status, so any call site participates without prop-drilling. Concurrent mutations
// nest via the counter, so the bar stays up until the LAST one settles.
